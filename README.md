# AutoLayoutDemo
These cases are a little contrived as you could use a UIStackView to accomplish these. But it is simple so we can talk about wiring up constraints.

## Basic Horizontal Menu items
**Story:** "I want the middle view to be equal size with the others but no wider than 200 points, and the side views should be pinned to each side."
- Layout with IB first
- Then try adding constraints using code.

## Prompt Buttons
**Story:** "For _Donation By Text_ button, if there is no more space, have the text expand into multiple lines if needed."
- Layout with IB using hugging/compression
